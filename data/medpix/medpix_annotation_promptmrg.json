Shrapnel overlies the midline and surgical clips are noted at the right lung apex. These findings are consistent with right hydropnemothorax. Also, with noted subcutaneous air over the right neck, these findings altogether make this concerning for bronchopleural fistulous formation between the right pleural space and the subcutaneous tissues of the right neck. CXR2: There is a moderate sized right apical pneumothorax with air fluid level within the mid portion of the right hemithorax consistent with a hydropneumothorax. There is opacification along the right lateral thoracic wall with additional right basilar opacification. Again, there is a large subcutaneous collection of air along the soft tissues overlying the right apex. Also noted are multiple riht apical posterior rib fractures unchanged from previous films. Persistent opacification along the lateral aspect of the right lower lung and along the right lung base is consistent with tracking pleural fluid and adjacent atelectasis. CT scans: Within the right hemithorax, there is a persistent moderate sized pleural effusion with a focal area of fluid at the right lung apex with an internal air fluid level consistent with loculated hydropneumothorax. Along the anterior aspect of this focal fluid collection there is soft tissue density material with internal air bronchograms as well as heterogeneous low density material which may represent an infarcted portion of the right upper lobe. A prior chest tube tract is appreciated along the anterior lateral aspect of the right thorax. Interval increase in size of the patient’s right apical subcutaneous emphysema as well as increased size of the patient’s right hydropneumothorax consistent with bronchopleural fistula with continued communication to the subcutaneous tissues likely via the posterior apical comminuted rib fractures. Findings also suggestive of lung infarction involving the posterior aspect of the right upper lobe.",

Next 3 images: Within the right lung base there is a large area of consolidation with accompanying bronchiectasis as well as a cavitary lesion with an air fluid level. Several additional areas of patchy opacity are present likely representing accompanying atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No enlarged lymph nodes are identified. Last image: There is a cluster of well-defined thin-walled cysts in the right lung base, some of which are confluent. The previously noted marked soft tissue thickening around them has resolved during the study interval as has the air-fluid level. No soft tissue thickening persists in this region.

Just proximal to the takeoff of the left subclavian artery is a significant web across the lumen of the aortic. This aortic web is seen to cause significant obstruction of flow through the aorta. A momentary delay was seen before blood flow was seen distal to the obstruction. A central post-stenotic jet was seen traveling through the thoracic aorta to below the level of the diaphragm. No obvious collateral blood vessels are noted throughout the thoracic aorta. No other cardiac abnormalities were identified.",

Steady state free precession is a relatively newer MR pulse sequence that provides good homogeneity of the bright blood pool signal and confirms the aortic dilatation noted on black blood images (Figures C and D). On cine bright blood MR using fast gradient echo imaging, a distinctive systolic flow jet (Figure E, arrow) is noted which arises from the posterior aortic valve into the ascending aorta. This moderate to large jet is consistent with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. No diastolic jet to suggest aortic insufficiency was seen (not shown). On cine bright blood phase contrast imaging at the level of the aortic valve, the aortic valve orifice is noted to be lens shaped (Figure F, arrowheads). Contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MRA (Figure G) confirmed the dilated ascending aortic root and absence of an aortic dissection or coarctation.",

Steady state free precession is a relatively newer MR pulse sequence that provides good homogeneity of the bright blood pool signal and confirms the aortic dilatation noted on black blood images (Figures C and D). On cine bright blood MR using fast gradient echo imaging, a distinctive systolic flow jet (Figure E, arrow) is noted which arises from the posterior aortic valve into the ascending aorta. This moderate to large jet is consistent with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. No diastolic jet to suggest aortic insufficiency was seen (not shown). On cine bright blood phase contrast imaging at the level of the aortic valve, the aortic valve orifice is noted to be lens shaped (Figure F, arrowheads). Contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MRA (Figure G) confirmed the dilated ascending aortic root and absence of an aortic dissection or coarctation.",

On cine bright blood MR using fast gradient echo imaging, a distinctive systolic flow jet (Figure E, arrow) is noted which arises from the posterior aortic valve into the ascending aorta. This moderate to large jet is consistent with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. No diastolic jet to suggest aortic insufficiency was seen (not shown). On cine bright blood phase contrast imaging at the level of the aortic valve, the aortic valve orifice is noted to be lens shaped (Figure F, arrowheads).

The patient’s support devices are stable when compared to the prior studies. On hospital day 10 the patient experienced worsening respiratory distress, and an unenhanced CT of the chest was performed.

Otherwise, there are no mediastinal or hilar masses identified, and no adenopathy is evident. Atherosclerotic calcific changes of the aorta and coronary arteries are present. There is no evidence of aneurysmal dilation. Left greater than right-sided simple-appearing pleural effusions are present with underlying compressive atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear and evenly aerated without evidence of mass, calcification or pulmonary parenchymal disease. The airways appear normal, and no thickening is evident. Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are seen. The visualized upper abdomen as well as the remainder of the visualized soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.

Steady state free precession is a relatively newer MR pulse sequence that provides good homogeneity of the bright blood pool signal and confirms the aortic dilatation noted on black blood images (Figures C and D). On cine bright blood MR using fast gradient echo imaging, a distinctive systolic flow jet (Figure E, arrow) is noted which arises from the posterior aortic valve into the ascending aorta. This moderate to large jet is consistent with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. No diastolic jet to suggest aortic insufficiency was seen (not shown). On cine bright blood phase contrast imaging at the level of the aortic valve, the aortic valve orifice is noted to be lens shaped (Figure F, arrowheads). Contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MRA (Figure G) confirmed the dilated ascending aortic root and absence of an aortic dissection or coarctation.",

Lateral chest radiograph demonstrates nodular pleural thickening involving the right upper lung margin, and a small pleural effusion is noted. When compared to the chest radiograph from 3.5 months prior, this area of nodular, irregular pleural thickening, and right pleural effusion is relatively new. Contrast enhanced axial CT images through various levels of the chest demonstrate a unilateral right sided pleural effusion, with mildly enhancing circumferential, nodular, irregular thickened pleura, encasing the right hemithorax with a rindlike appearance. Additionally, there is focal nodularity of the mediastinal pleura. There is no significant adenopathy, nor evidence of a chest wall abnormality",

Steady state free precession is a relatively newer MR pulse sequence that provides good homogeneity of the bright blood pool signal and confirms the aortic dilatation noted on black blood images (Figures C and D). On cine bright blood MR using fast gradient echo imaging, a distinctive systolic flow jet (Figure E, arrow) is noted which arises from the posterior aortic valve into the ascending aorta. This moderate to large jet is consistent with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. No diastolic jet to suggest aortic insufficiency was seen (not shown). On cine bright blood phase contrast imaging at the level of the aortic valve, the aortic valve orifice is noted to be lens shaped (Figure F, arrowheads). Contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MRA (Figure G) confirmed the dilated ascending aortic root and absence of an aortic dissection or coarctation.",

Frontal chest radiograph taken at 72hrs demonstrates interval placement of endotracheal tube and right-sided central venous catheter. New right-sided subcutaneous air. Hypoinflation and mils increased interstitial markings of the lungs. Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval development of moderate right-sided pneumothorax CT: Chest CT demonstrating diffuse patchy bilateral upper and lower lobe groundglass opacities. Differential considerations include PCP and CMV pneumonia as well as other opportunistic infection. This could represent hypersensitivity pneumonitis.",

Hospital Day 2: AP chest radiograph demonstrates a stable right subclavian venous catheter, with bibasilar reticulonodular ground glass opacities. Hospital Day 6: AP chest radiograph from hospital day 6, reveals that the patient has been intubated, and has developed a spontaneous pneumomediastinum with extensive subcutaneous emphysema surrounding the neck. There is no pneumothorax. There are continued bibasilar reticulonodular ground glass opacities. AP chest radiograph from hospital day 6, obtained later in the day secondary to new respiratory distress, reveals that the patient has developed a significant left sided pneumothorax, with persistent pneumomediastinum, bibasilar ground-glass reticulonodular opacities, and subcutaneous emphysema surrounding the base of the neck. The patient’s support devices are stable when compared to the prior studies. On hospital day 10 the patient experienced worsening respiratory distress, and an unenhanced CT of the chest was performed. An axial image at the level of the aortic arch demonstrates continued pneumomediastinum, and a left-sided pneumothorax. There is a small right-sided pleural effusion, with persistent ground-glass opacities. An axial image at the level of the hila demonstrates continued pneumomediastinum, and a left-sided pneumothorax. There are persistent ground-glass opacities with focal areas of consolidation. An axial image at the level of the right hemidiaphragm demonstrates continued pneumomediastinum, and a left-sided pneumothorax.

Degenerative changes are visualized throughout the bony structures. IMPRESSION: 1. Stable appearance of left atrial and ventricular enlargement in the setting of dextrocardia. PA PROTOCOL CHEST CT: FINDINGS: There are sternotomy wires surrounded by bone, suggesting surgery at a young age. There is mirror image anatomy of the heart and upper abdominal organs, findings consistent with the patient\"s known situs inversus. The patient has a left-sided aortic arch with mirror image branching vessels. The right side of the heart is enlarged, as is the main pulmonary artery, which demonstrates some possible focal narrowing just distal to the pulmonic valve. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism. There is focal band-like attenuation in the lower lungs, likely representing bibasilar atelectasis. No bronchiectasis is seen. IMPRESSION: 1. Findings consistent with situs inversus with a left aortic arch and mirror image branching vessels. 2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

Shrapnel overlies the midline and surgical clips are noted at the right lung apex. These findings are consistent with right hydropnemothorax. Also, with noted subcutaneous air over the right neck, these findings altogether make this concerning for bronchopleural fistulous formation between the right pleural space and the subcutaneous tissues of the right neck. CXR2: There is a moderate sized right apical pneumothorax with air fluid level within the mid portion of the right hemithorax consistent with a hydropneumothorax. There is opacification along the right lateral thoracic wall with additional right basilar opacification. Again, there is a large subcutaneous collection of air along the soft tissues overlying the right apex. Also noted are multiple riht apical posterior rib fractures unchanged from previous films. Persistent opacification along the lateral aspect of the right lower lung and along the right lung base is consistent with tracking pleural fluid and adjacent atelectasis. CT scans: Within the right hemithorax, there is a persistent moderate sized pleural effusion with a focal area of fluid at the right lung apex with an internal air fluid level consistent with loculated hydropneumothorax. Along the anterior aspect of this focal fluid collection there is soft tissue density material with internal air bronchograms as well as heterogeneous low density material which may represent an infarcted portion of the right upper lobe. A prior chest tube tract is appreciated along the anterior lateral aspect of the right thorax. Interval increase in size of the patient’s right apical subcutaneous emphysema as well as increased size of the patient’s right hydropneumothorax consistent with bronchopleural fistula with continued communication to the subcutaneous tissues likely via the posterior apical comminuted rib fractures. Findings also suggestive of lung infarction involving the posterior aspect of the right upper lobe.",

Chest and abdomal CT on 16 August 2006 after 4 months of chemotherapy and radiation revealed the following in comparison with the 13 April 2006 study: Subcarinal lymphadenopathy is demonstrated and increased from previous study. Associated rib destruction is demonstrated. Associated endobronchial narrowing is demonstrated extending to the right lower lobe. No pulmonary nodules are seen in the left lung. Interval development of bilateral adrenal masses. Soft tissue masses are demonstrated within the mesentery. Interval development of right gluteal mass",

Just proximal to the takeoff of the left subclavian artery is a significant web across the lumen of the aortic. This aortic web is seen to cause significant obstruction of flow through the aorta. A momentary delay was seen before blood flow was seen distal to the obstruction. A central post-stenotic jet was seen traveling through the thoracic aorta to below the level of the diaphragm. No obvious collateral blood vessels are noted throughout the thoracic aorta. No other cardiac abnormalities were identified.",
